<p>We are absolutely thrilled to announce that Bloomberg Philanthropies has awarded San Francisco with a 3-year grant focused on “digital innovation.”   

<p>As part of its Innovation in Government portfolio, Bloomberg Philanthropies (the charitable foundation started by former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg) has already funded more that 40 “i-teams” in mayor’s offices around the world. This year, San Francisco joins a cohort alongside Amsterdam, Netherlands; Bogotá, Colombia; Mexico City, Mexico; Reykjavík, Iceland; and Washington, DC. 

<p>In conjunction with the grant, we’re also excited to announce that the Office of Civic Innovation will be rebranding – you can call us the Mayor’s Office of Innovation from here on out.
